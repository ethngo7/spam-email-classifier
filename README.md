ðŸ“¨ Spam Email Classifier

A logistic regression model that predicts whether an email is spam or not based on custom-engineered text features.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores how to classify emails as spam or not spam using interpretable, hand-engineered features derived from email content and metadata. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails and evaluated using accuracy and AUC.

## Features Used

- Presence of HTML tags (`<...>`)
- Special character detection (e.g. `$`, `%`)
- Number of exclamation marks
- Word count and average word length
- Subject line presence and length
- Presence of key words like:  
  `['body', 'business', 'html', 'money', 'offer', 'please', 'form', 'content', 'center']`

## ðŸ“Š Key Results

- Achieved ~90% accuracy on the validation set
- AUC score of ~92%, indicating strong model performance
- Visualizations highlight feature importance and class distribution
- Focused on **interpretable, transparent classification**

## ðŸ§  Tools Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, re, etc.)
- Logistic Regression
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plots)
